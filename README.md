# Tic-Tac-Toe-Game1

Project: Ty's Tic Tac Toe Game 

I choose to do Tic-Tac-Toe as my browser game choice for this project because it was a game I always played as a kid and I liked how versitle and easy it was to play. All you would need is something to write with and something to write on and you were able to play a quick game of tic tac to anywhere. 

The instructions of the game are included on the board for those who may not know how to play tic tac toe or some how have never even heard of the game. (Which would be crazy!)

Hope you enjoy playing! 


Some of the sources that helped me create this project were:
